# 
This proposal outlines a decentralized application (dApp) built on 0G Labs’ blockchain infrastructure to manage traditional NFTs and intelligent NFTs (iNFTs). Going straight to its main function this Asset dynamic engine enables users to: 

Store: Temporarily lock NFTs/iNFTs in a decentralized vault, preserving their utility over a given period of time. 

Burn: Permanently remove NFTs/iNFTs from circulation and trim down the collection to cause scarcity and increase want. 

Merge: Fuse two stored NFTs or iNFTs into a third asset, locking originals’ rights until the merged result is burned then we can return the rights and return the iNFT and NFT to thier original code.

Designed for EVM compatibility along with 0G Labs’ scalable data availability (DA) layer, 0G Storage, and AI-oracle system, this dApp offers a user-friendly interface atop a robust smart contract backend, leveraging decentralized principles for transparency and autonomy.

Objectives
User Empowerment: Provide an intuitive dApp for managing NFT/iNFT lifecycles.

Cross-Asset Support: Handle static NFTs and dynamic iNFTs with tailored merging logic.

Decentralized Control: Ensure all actions (store, burn, merge) are trustless and verifiable on-chain.

0G Integration: Maximize 0G Labs’ AI, storage, and scalability for efficiency and innovation.

A.D.E Architecture

1. Frontend (User Interface)
Tech: React.js, Web3.js (or ethers.js) for blockchain interaction.

Features:
Dashboard: Displays user-owned NFTs/iNFTs (stored, active, merged).

Store Button: Triggers storage transaction with wallet approval (e.g., MetaMask).

Burn Button: Initiates burn with confirmation prompt.

Merge Tool: Selects two stored assets, previews fused result (via AI simulation), and submits merge.

Burn Merged: Option to burn merged assets and reclaim originals.

NOTE: UX must have a Clean design with tooltips explaining rights transfer and burn-reversal rules.

2. Backend (Smart Contract)
Tech: Solidity, deployed on Ethereum with 0G Labs’ DA layer for scalability.

Core Functions:

Storage: Locks assets in a vault.

Burn: Deletes assets permanently.

Merger: Fuses stored NFTs/iNFTs, mints a new asset, and manages rights.

3. Off-Chain Integration (0G Labs’ Stack)
0G Storage: Hosts static NFT metadata and encrypted iNFT AI metadata.

AI-Oracles: Fuses metadata (NFT traits, iNFT AI models) and delivers new URIs.

DA Layer: Ensures low-cost, verifiable logging of all actions.

System Design. 

1. Storage Feature

Purpose: Allow users to park NFTs/iNFTs securely, preserving them for later use or merging.

dApp Flow:
User selects NFT/iNFT in dashboard → Clicks “Store” → Signs transaction → Asset moves to storageVault.

Status updates to “Stored” in UI.
Contract: store(uint256 tokenId) locks asset, sets isStored[tokenId] = true.

0G Role: Metadata persists on 0G Storage; DA layer logs for transparency.

Use Case: 
Store a rare NFT during a bear market.

2. Burn Feature
Purpose: Enable permanent removal of NFTs/iNFTs from circulation.

dApp Flow:
User selects active (non-stored) NFT/iNFT → Clicks “Burn” → Confirms in wallet → Asset is burned.

UI removes asset from dashboard.
Contract: burn(uint256 tokenId) sends to 0x…dEaD; iNFT metadata wiped by oracle.

0G Role: AI suggests burn candidates (e.g., low activity) via analytics feed.

Use Case:
 Burn duplicate NFTs to boost collection value.

3. Merger Feature (NFTs and iNFTs)
Purpose: Fuse two stored NFTs or iNFTs into a third asset, locking originals until the merged result is burned.

dApp Flow:
User selects two stored assets → Sees AI-generated preview (e.g., “Red Ape” or “Sword Bot”) → Clicks “Merge” → Signs transaction.

New asset appears in dashboard; originals marked “Merged - Locked.”

To reclaim: Select merged asset → Click “Burn Merged” → Originals return.

Contract:
merge(uint256 tokenId1, uint256 tokenId2):
Locks #1 and #2 (mergedInto[tokenId] = newTokenId).

Fuses metadata:
NFT + NFT: AI blends traits (e.g., “glasses” + “hat” = “stylish headgear”).

iNFT + iNFT: Oracle merges AI models (e.g., trader + gamer = hybrid AI).

NFT + iNFT: Combines static + dynamic (e.g., art + bot = artistic AI).

Mints #3 (NFT or iNFT based on inputs).

burnMerged(uint256 mergedTokenId): Burns #3, releases #1 and #2.

Rules:
Merging requires stored assets; #3 mints only after rights lock.

Originals reclaimable only by burning #3.

0G Role: AI previews fusion; oracles process iNFT merges; 0G Storage hosts new metadata.

Use Cases:
Merge two NFTs: Punk + Ape = “Punked Ape” NFT.

Merge two iNFTs: Trader + Optimizer = “Profit Gamer” iNFT.

Merge NFT + iNFT: Sword NFT + Combat iNFT = “Swordmaster Bot” iNFT.

dApp Benefits

User-Friendly: Frontend simplifies complex blockchain actions.

Versatile Merging: Handles NFT trait combos and iNFT AI fusion.

Decentralized: No central point of failure; all ops on-chain or via 0G’s stack.

0G Boost: AI previews, scalable DA, and secure storage elevate the experience.

Challenges

Gas Fees: Merging and burn-reversal could get costly; 0G’s DA layer helps but doesn’t eliminate.

Fusion Rules: NFT trait blending needs fine-tuning (e.g., rarity weights).

Learning Curve: Burn-to-reclaim might confuse newbies—UI must educate.

Why 0G Labs?

Scalability: DA layer keeps gas low for mass adoption.

AI Power: Drives smart NFT/iNFT fusion and burn suggestions.

Storage: 0G Storage secures metadata and locked assets.

Development Roadmap

Smart Contract: Deploy on 0G testnet; test storage, burn, merge cycles.

Frontend: Build React UI with Web3.js integration.

AI Tuning: Define fusion logic (e.g., 70% trait A, 30% trait B for NFTs).

Launch: Roll out on Ethereum mainnet with 0G enhancements; promote via X.
