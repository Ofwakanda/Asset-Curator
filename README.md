# Asset Curator

# A Decentralized Engine for NFT Management, Verification, and AI Fusion

## Version: 3.0
## Date: May 8th, 2025

## Introduction

As the NFT ecosystem continues to evolve, there is a growing demand for more intelligent, interoperable, and verifiable digital assets. While traditional NFTs offer provenance and ownership, they fall short when it comes to dynamic functionality, AI integration, and robust lifecycle control. This limitation becomes more prominent as the industry transitions toward utility-based NFTs, AI agents, and composable on-chain identity systems.

 Asset Curator addresses these gaps by introducing a decentralized framework for managing static NFTs and intelligent NFTs (iNFTs) through an integrated suite of mechanisms: Store, Burn, Merge, and Verify. These components are designed to ensure secure custody, enforce digital scarcity, enable creative recombination, and protect originality through on-chain validation and scoring.

The protocol leverages 0G Labs’ decentralized infrastructure to support storage, logging, and AI-based verification, providing the necessary backbone for scalable and trustless asset evolution.

## System Overview

Asset Curator introduces the concept of NFT Lifecycle Control, in which NFTs and iNFTs can transition between stored, burned, merged, and verified states. Each state transition is mediated by a suite of smart contracts and AI-assisted oracle modules that provide verifiability, auditability, and data integrity across operations.

## Key Components:

Decentralized Storage System

On-Chain Burn Mechanism 

Fusion Engine

Derivative Control System 

Remint System for Legacy Collections

Onchain Branding 

AI-Avatar Creation




## Decentralized Storage System [ DSS ]
 
The DCS function is a fundamental component of the Asset Curator, enabling secure custodianship of NFTs and iNFTs within a decentralized storage system. This mechanism provides both a protective layer for high-value or in-progress assets and a functional gate for downstream operations such as merging, burning, or originality verification, securely lock NFTs and iNFTs in decentralized vaults managed by AC smart contract suite.

## When an asset is submitted to the storage system:

1. The asset is assigned a unique vault ID and indexed in the protocol’s on-chain registry.


2. The asset remains under the original owner’s wallet but becomes non-transferable until explicitly released.


3. A cryptographic snapshot (hash) of the asset's metadata is taken and stored alongside the vault record.


4. The asset is flagged as “vaulted,” disabling marketplace transfers, fusions, or burns unless released or authorized.


This system ensures deterministic control over asset states while preserving provenance and usage rights
Collectors can also lock prized assets to prevent accidental sale or exposure. A specified unlock date or manual withdrawal ensures long-term security.

Before initiating a fusion operation, all input NFTs must be stored. This guarantees that source assets are immutable throughout the fusion validation process.

DAOs, institutions, or creators may store NFTs as a form of decentralized “vault insurance,” proving asset control without relying on centralized storage platforms.


## On-Chain Burn Mechanism 

The burn mechanism is designed to enforce controlled destruction of NFTs and iNFTs. Unlike typical burn operations that simply remove tokens from circulation, the Asset Curator burn mechanism is embedded with traceability, rights reconciliation, and lifecycle logic for complex asset ecosystems, including AI-enhanced digital identities. Basically it ensures the permanently removal of NFTs and iNFTs from circulation via an irreversible on-chain burn mechanism.

## When an asset is submitted to the burn mechanism:

1. The token is permanently removed from the NFT contract, triggering a total supply reduction.

2. The protocol checks whether the burned token is a fused asset. If so, it initiates a restoration flow for original components stored in the vault.

3. A cryptographic fingerprint of the burned token’s metadata is retained for auditability and proof-of-burn purposes.


Project founders or DAO communities may burn unclaimed or underperforming assets to reduce total supply and enhance the rarity of remaining collectibles.

Burns can also be used to remove deprecated or low-quality NFTs from circulation, especially when paired with community governance through originality scoring or flagging.

Burns also eliminate duplicates, abandoned, or low-utility assets to maintain ecosystem integrity.




## Fusion Engine: 

The Fusion Engine enables the compositional fusion of two NFTs, iNFTs, or a combination of both into a new AI-enhanced digital asset. This operation goes beyond standard metadata aggregation by introducing a programmable AI layer, originality scoring, rights locking, and on-chain provenance that enforces creativity, trust, and interoperability, Fuse two stored assets NFTs, iNFTs, or one of each into a new, AI-enhanced hybrid asset.


## When the fusion of (assetA, assetB) is executed:

1. Both assets are validated for ADEX-brand compliance and fusion eligibility via originality score thresholds and metadata integrity checks.


2. Original NFTs/iNFTs are cryptographically locked in the ADEX Vault smart contract to prevent future manipulation, sale, or reminting during their fused state.


3. The AI Oracle is called to generate a fusion preview and originality score based on a synthesis of visual traits, behavior models, and metadata.


4. A new iNFT is minted containing fused metadata, traits, and optionally an AI personality layer (e.g. Tactical AI, Creative Synth, etc.).


Combine visual traits, metadata, and behavioral models to produce new, intelligent or aesthetic NFTs.

Enable the creation of iNFTs with personality layers, skill sets, or strategy modules (e.g., Tactical Mind iNFT, Augmented Artist iNFT).

Original assets are locked in the vault post-merge. Burn of the fused asset is required to reclaim and restore the originals.
Originality is scored and verified by the Derivative Control System.




# Derivative Control System 

The Derivative Control System (DCS) evaluates and governs the originality, authenticity, and derivative status of NFTs and iNFTs within the ecosystem. It ensures that only unique, innovative, or sufficiently transformed digital assets are allowed to participate in advanced features like fusion, verified reminting, and branding.






4. Verified Founder Remint System
   
To allow original creators to remint existing collections or individual collectibles without altering value, embedding Asset Curator authenticity, and joining the ADEX database.

On-chain Brand Registry:
Attach the ADEX brand as a seal of authenticity and originality to verified reminted collections.

Preserve Legacy Value:
Remint without disrupting ownership history or price charts by retaining original token IDs, contract ancestry, and provenance data.

Integrate with ADEX Engine:
Reconstructed collections gain access to the full ADE stack: store, burn, merge, originality scoring, and AI metadata augmentation.

How it works. 

1. Creator verifies contract ownership (via wallet signature)

2. Submits collection for originality scanning

3. If passed:

Marked as ADEX-Branded
