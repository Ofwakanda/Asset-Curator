Decentralized Engine for NFT Management, Verification, and AI Fusion

Version: 2.0
Date: May 6th 2025
Authors: ADEX Team


ADEX (Asset Dynamic Engine X) is a decentralized application framework built on top of 0G Labs' blockchain infrastructure, designed to manage the full lifecycle of traditional NFTs and intelligent NFTs (iNFTs). ADEX introduces a core mechanism of Store, Burn, and Merge to allow secure management, scarcity-driven valuation, and advanced fusion of digital assets. With an emphasis on verified reminting, AI-powered originality scoring, and branded on-chain metadata, ADEX ensures asset legitimacy, interoperability, and scalable utility across the Web3 ecosystem.

Vision
To create a unified, trustless, and intelligent infrastructure that facilitates the evolution of static and dynamic NFTs into verified, functional, and interoperable on-chain assets for personal identity, gamified systems, collectibles, and AI-assisted interactions.

Core Modules

1. STORE FUNCTION
Securely lock NFTs and iNFTs in decentralized vaults managed by ADEX’s smart contract suite.

Purpose:
Asset Preservation:
Temporarily remove assets from circulation during market downturns to retain value and reduce volatility.

Rights Management:
Store NFTs/iNFTs before merging to enable rights locking—ensuring originals cannot be manipulated while derivatives exist.

Institutional & Long-Term Holding:
Provides a secure custody layer for DAOs, brands, or collectors looking to safeguard high-value assets with verifiable on-chain proofs.

2. BURN FUNCTION
Permanently remove NFTs and iNFTs from circulation via an irreversible on-chain burn mechanism.

Purpose:
Scarcity & Value Boost:
Reduce overall supply to elevate rarity and desirability across collections.

Quality Control:
Eliminate duplicates, abandoned, or low-utility assets to maintain ecosystem integrity.

Rights Reclamation:
Burn fused (merged) assets to unlock and restore rights to the original NFTs/iNFTs stored in the vault.

MERGE FUNCTION:
Fuse two stored assets NFTs, iNFTs, or one of each into a new, AI-enhanced hybrid asset.

Purpose:
Creative & AI-Assisted Fusion:
Combine visual traits, metadata, and behavioral models to produce new, intelligent or aesthetic NFTs.

iNFT Generation:
Enable the creation of iNFTs with personality layers, skill sets, or strategy modules (e.g., Tactical Mind iNFT, Augmented Artist iNFT).

Rights Lock & Verification:
Original assets are locked in the vault post-merge. Burn of the fused asset is required to reclaim and restore the originals.
Originality is scored and verified by the Derivative Control System.


NOTE:
The ADEX system is natively integrated with 0G Labs' decentralized infrastructure, enabling a secure, efficient, and scalable backbone for NFT and iNFT lifecycle management.

0G Storage for secure metadata

DA Layer for scalable logs

AI Oracle for fusion previews and originality checks. 



4. Verified Founder Remint System
To allow original creators to remint existing collections or individual collectibles without altering value, embedding ADEX authenticity, and joining the ADEX database.

Purpose:
On-chain Brand Registry:
Attach the ADEX brand as a seal of authenticity and originality to verified reminted collections.

Preserve Legacy Value:
Remint without disrupting ownership history or price charts by retaining original token IDs, contract ancestry, and provenance data.

Integrate with ADEX Engine:
Reconstructed collections gain access to the full ADE stack: store, burn, merge, originality scoring, and AI metadata augmentation.

How it works. 
1. Creator verifies contract ownership (via wallet signature)

2. Submits collection for originality scanning

3. If passed:

Marked as ADEX-Branded

Mint-Type: Rebuild

Included in searchable registry

4. If failed:

Blocked from reminting

Flagged as non-original or low-quality derivative
 Characters

Benefits for Founders:
Rebuild & Evolve:
Update metadata, visuals, and on-chain capabilities for modern standards without breaking the legacy ecosystem.

AI Enhancements:
Option to convert static assets into iNFTs or add dynamic AI layers via 0G Oracle AI tools.

Derivative Control:
Prevent unauthorized forks and fakes by establishing on-chain branded authority tied to founder wallet.


5. Onchain Branding System
Every NFT or iNFT minted via ADEX is authenticated with cryptographic, verifiable originality markers.

Core Branding Elements:

i. Provenance Hash
Cryptographically ties the asset to its origin.

Combines metadata, mint wallet, and timestamp into an immutable hash.

ii. ADEX Contract Signature
ADEX’s minting contract signs each NFT/iNFT at the point of creation.

Verifies authenticity and protocol compliance.

iii. Originality Score (0–100)
Derived from the Derivative Control System.

Determines branding level and eligibility for platform features.


Benefits of Onchain Branding:
Trusted Marketplace Interoperability
Branded NFTs/iNFTs are more likely to be accepted or highlighted on third-party marketplaces due to verifiable authenticity.

Fusion Eligibility
Only ADEX-branded assets can participate in merge functions and iNFT hybrid creation.

Avatar Protocol Whitelisting
Enables branded assets to be integrated into avatar systems (on-chain identity, social metaverse, AI companions).

Anti-Fraud Layer
Protects collectors from derivative fakes and unauthorized mint copies.



6. Asset Intelligence [Self-Minting & Avatar Creation]

Users can mint themselves via: Webcam photo + AI body modeling and It’s permanently linked to the wallet via On-chain linked wallet metadata. 

These minted profiles can be merged with our AI assistants e.g Chat agents, Trader, Storyteller, Defender, assistant, etc. Let your Avatar work for you!

Fusion Example. 

You (avatar) + Strategy AI = "Tactical Mind iNFT"
Use Case
Real-time Tactical Decisioning: Adaptively strategizes in competitive blockchain games.

Auto-Pilot Mode: Plays in your style when you're offline, winning passive rewards.


You + Synth Designer = "Augmented Artist iNFT"
Purpose 
Autonomous Art Generation: Generates original digital artwork, music, or animation in your style.

On-Chain Commissions: Users submit requests; your iNFT delivers creative outputs autonomously and receives payments.
Etc. 


7. Derivative Control System (DCS)
To assess, label, and control the minting and acceptance of NFTs and iNFTs within the ADEX Engine to preserve originality, prevent copy-minting, and manage collection integrity.

Inputs for Evaluation:

Visual Similarity

Metadata Overlap

Contract Ancestry

Lore

Utility similarity

Outputs After Evaluation. 

Score Range:

0–100 scale of originality.

Label:

Original (80–100) – Unique in form and origin.

Inspired (60–79) – Clearly derivative but moderately original.

Duplicate (0–59) – Copy or minimally altered from an existing asset.


8. Governance & DAO Vision
The ADEX ecosystem will transition toward decentralized governance by enabling the community to actively participate in maintaining originality, shaping AI policy, and guiding platform evolution.

Key Components

i. Public Registry of Flagged/Rejected Assets

Transparent Ledger: Every NFT/iNFT flagged as “Inspired” or “Duplicate” is listed in a public on-chain registry.

Metadata Access: Includes asset score, failure criteria, contract ancestry, and reason for rejection.

Educational Use: Helps creators understand originality standards.

ii. Community-Based Originality Challenge System
Dispute Mechanism: Creators or users can challenge originality scores via DAO proposals.

Evidence Submission: Includes creative drafts, timelines, or source files.
Staking Requirement: Both challenger and challenged stake tokens for anti-spam.

Outcome:
If challenge succeeds: score is updated, asset reclassified.

If challenge fails: staked tokens are distributed to voters or burned.

ADEX represents the next evolution of digital asset creation, merging blockchain transparency, AI intelligence, and user identity into a unified, decentralized platform. By introducing tools like onchain branding, originality scoring, and intelligent fusion mechanisms, ADEX empowers users, creators, and founders to define the value, purpose, and legacy of their NFTs and iNFTs. Whether preserving iconic collections, generating new hybrid identities, or enabling AI-powered avatars, ADEX lays the foundation for a trustable, creative, and scalable digital economy driven by authenticity, governed by community, and built for the future.
